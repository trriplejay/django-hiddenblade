    <p>It's assassins time! come on, grab your friends.</p>

    <p>Create a group, invite your friends, set some ground rules, and start a game.  </p>

    <p>At first, the only game type available is in the traditional "assassins" style, where each player is assigned a target, and killing their target yields a new one until the last assassin standing becomes the winner!</p>

    <p>In the future we hope to make other game types available, such as free for all, team deathmatch, protect the VIP, and more!</p>
